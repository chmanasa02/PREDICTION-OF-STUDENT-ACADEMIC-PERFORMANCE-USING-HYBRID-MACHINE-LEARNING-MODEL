# üìö Student Academic Performance Prediction Using Hybrid ML Model
This repository contains a hybrid machine learning model designed to predict student academic performance. It leverages classification algorithms to identify students at risk of underperforming, helping educators make data-informed decisions to support and improve academic outcomes.
## üìä Project Overview

### üìå **Problem Statement** 
The goal of this project is to predict student academic performance using demographic, academic, and behavioral data. The system should help educators intervene early for students at risk.

### üßæ **Dataset** 

* **Source**: `dataset.csv` (CSV format)
* **Records**: \~4400 students
* **Features**: Age, study time, parental education, past grades, absences, etc.
* **Target Variable**: `Target` ‚Äì Academic performance classification (e.g., Pass/Fail)

---

### üîÑ **Workflow Steps**

#### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**

* Checked for null values and data types
* Handled categorical variables with label encoding
* Visualized distributions and correlations using seaborn and matplotlib

#### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Feature Engineering**

* Extracted input features (X) and target variable (y)
* Split the data into training and testing sets (70/30 split)

#### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Model Building**

Trained multiple classification algorithms:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Decision Tree (DT)
* Random Forest (RF)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Neural Networks (MLP Classifier)
* Naive Bayes
* Voting Ensemble
* **Stacked Ensemble Model** (final hybrid model)

#### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Evaluation Metrics**

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix
* Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

### üí° **Key Insights**

* Hybrid model combining KNN,LR, RF, DT, SVM, MLP, and NB yielded the best performance.
* Features such as **study time, parental education, absences, and past grades** were highly predictive.
* Logistic Regression and Random Forest individually performed well, but stacking improved overall accuracy.
